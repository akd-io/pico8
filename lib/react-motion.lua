  Motion.p8
  This library tries to implement the most relevant features of the React
  Motion library for Pico-8.
  See the original library here: https://motion.dev/

  REQUIREMENTS:
  - react.lua
]]

--[[
  TODOs:
  - Support adding config to `useSpring`?. Like `useSpring(0, { stiffness: 300 })`
  - Support `useTransition`. Linear?, bezier?, frame-by-frame value array?
  - Support AnimatePresence.
  - Like Motion.Div, etc., support Motion wrappers for drawing functions.
    I.e. components that accept `initial`, `animate`, and `exit` props to
    animate draw function args.
    - Support all drawing functions: pset, sset, fset, print, cursor, color,
      cls, camera, circ, circfill, oval, ovalfill, line, rect, rectfill, pal,
      palt, spr, sspr, fillp, mset, map, tline.
    - Possible big brain: Consider making a single Motion component that just
      takes the drawing function as input as well as `initial`, `animate`, and
      `exit`.
      - Usage could look like:
          return { Motion, rect, {
            initial: { 0, 0, 10, 10 },
            animate: { 10, 10, 20, 20 },
            exit: { 20, 20, 30, 30 }
          } }
      - At second glance, would we really want motion rect in the output?
        There's no HTML forcing us to do this. We could implement the Motion
        component as a useMotion hook instead. This could look like:
          useMotion(rect, {
            initial: { 0, 0, 10, 10 },
            animate: { 10, 10, 20, 20 },
            exit: { 20, 20, 30, 30 }
          })
      - Pros for a Motion component over useMotion:
        - Can idiomatically be passed to components as children.
          - (But I guess this point is moot, isn't the question, what should be
            idiomatic?)
        - Keeping rendering to the output of the component, rather than
          rendering in a hook, might make react.p8 code more readable in the
          long run.
      - Pros for useMotion over a Motion component:
        - Can be composed in hooks.
        - Might be more performant than a component?
  - Possibly implement useContext in react.p8, and use that to set default
    animation settings, like spring config.
  - See if it's possible to release a pure Lua version and have this be a react
    wrapper.
    - I imagine we'll reach the fewest tokens in react-motion by baking not
      relying on another external implementation.
    - I should probably just release a `calcNextSpringPosition` function
