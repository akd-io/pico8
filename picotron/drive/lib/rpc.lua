  - Change name from RPC.
    - RPC is aleady only true in a vague sense, as we're only communicating between processes.
    - But also, the call of the local function wont return the result of the remote function.
      It will be caught in by the event handler.
    - We can release a proper RPC library later, on top of a promise abstraction if I or someone else makes one.

  - In usage, it's possible to specify `id` in the env patch, which will be returned in the response.
    This is useful for identifying the response when multiple RPC calls are made in quick succession.
    - It would have been nice to redesign createRPC to include `id` in the event name, eg. `rpc_response_<funcName>_<id>`.
      - But this is not possible, as unsubscribing from events is not supported.
        We would end up with thousands of subscriptions if we did this.
